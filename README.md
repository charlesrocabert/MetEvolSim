# MetEvolSim
SBML and Copasi-based simulator of metabolic networks evolution.

## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

MetEvolSim simulates the long-term evolution of metabolic concentrations, through the mutation of kinetic parameters. The program takes as an input any <a href="http://sbml.org/Main_Page">SBML</a> metabolic network model, as soon as kinetic parameters and initial metabolic concentrations are specified. Steady-state concentrations are compute thanks to <a href="http://copasi.org/">Copasi</a> software.
